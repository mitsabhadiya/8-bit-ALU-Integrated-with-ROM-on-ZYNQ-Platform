# 8-bit-ALU-Integrated-with-ROM-on-ZYNQ-Platform
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) integrated with a ROM (Read-Only Memory) on a ZYNQ-7000 SoC platform. The system demonstrates embedded system design principles by combining programmable logic (PL) and processing system (PS) capabilities.
